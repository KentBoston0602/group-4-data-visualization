The histograms display the quantity of available laptops in a specific price level. Most of the laptops that are currently manufactured in 
various regions globally can be classified as cost ranging betweeen 500 Euros and 1500 Euros. The laptops in the 1500 to 2500 euros price 
range are even fewer and there are very few laptops that cost more than 2500 euros. This implies that, though there are many quantities of

In general, the price of the laptop tends to go high when the RAM is high. This suggest that the two variables 
are positively related. This is a really interesting thing: laptops with equal amounts of RAM can cost a lot of 
money. This implies that RAM is not the only determinant of the price of a computer. It is also likely that other 
characteristics such as the processor, type of storage, graphic card, brand, and display probably contribute to it. 
There is a laptop that has 64 GB RAM which is actually cheaper than some laptops which have a much lower RAM. This 
could be an anomaly, a record that is quite different from the other records and could be followed up on.

Ultrabook follows with an average of **2.3 GHz**, offering a blend of performance and portability that is ideal for users who need a powerful yet lightweight device. Furthermore, Notebooks has an average CPU frequency of **2.21 GHz** which is perfect for a user that prioritizes efficiency and mobility. The 2 in 1 Convertible, on the other hand, has an average of **2.12 GHz** which offers flexibility and are designed to users that wants a device that can serve as both a laptop and a tablet.

    - The histogram below shows the prices for the laptops. They indicate that the majority of laptops are in the price segment of 500 to 1500 Euros.
    - The best way to illustrate the variability in the distribution is to show that as the price increases the number of laptops sold reduces and therefore we have a positively skewed distribution. From this we can deduce that there are a few costly laptops, however, a majority of them fall under the low-end category.
