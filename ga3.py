Based from the bar chart, we can observe that the average laptop prices differ from various companies of the dataset. 
Notably, ***Razer*** has an average price of **3346.142857**. It also records a maximum price of **6099.00** ðŸ’¸ 
(*see Numerical Data Description*). On the contrary, ***Vero*** which is at the bottom of the list has an average price of only **217.425000** ðŸ‘Œ. 
The mean or average price is **1134.969059** and based from this figure we could identify which companies tend to manufacture premium and affordable laptops ðŸ’».

The histograms display the quantity of available laptops in a specific price level. Most of the laptops that are currently manufactured in 
various regions globally can be classified as cost ranging betweeen 500 Euros and 1500 Euros. The laptops in the 1500 to 2500 euros price 
range are even fewer and there are very few laptops that cost more than 2500 euros. This implies that, though there are many quantities of 
interest in cheaper laptops, there are fewer quantities of interest in costly laptops.

    - The laptops from the dataset are mostly integrated with **_Intel_**'s GPU, constituting more than half (**55.2%**) of the distribution.
    - **_Nvidia_**'s GPU is also integrated into a significant portion (**31.1%**) of laptops from the dataset.
    - **_AMD_** is the third popular choice of GPU manufacturer (**13.6%**) integrated into laptops from the dataset.
    - **_ARM_** has a notably small share (**0.1%**), indicating that this GPU manufacturer is not a preferred option among the laptops.
